# Update Your Profile with Custom Images

## Steps to Update Your Profile:

1. **Get Direct Image URLs from ImgBB:**
   
   Your current links need to be converted to direct image URLs:
   
   - **Avatar**: `https://ibb.co/M5k6bj1F`
     - Right-click on the image → "Copy image address" or "Open image in new tab"
     - The direct URL should look like: `https://i.ibb.co/xxxxxxxx/filename.jpg`
   
   - **Cover Photo**: `https://ibb.co/bSZ6QMh`
     - Right-click on the image → "Copy image address" or "Open image in new tab"
     - The direct URL should look like: `https://i.ibb.co/xxxxxxxx/filename.jpg`

2. **Update Your Profile:**
   
   a. Go to your Av9Hub application
   b. Click on "Profile" in the navigation
   c. Click "Edit Profile" button
   d. Paste the direct image URLs:
      - Avatar URL: [paste your direct avatar image URL]
      - Cover Photo URL: [paste your direct cover photo URL]
   e. Click "Save Changes"

## Alternative: Using the Direct URLs

If you want to use the images directly, here are the likely direct URLs:

**Avatar (estimated):**
```
https://i.ibb.co/M5k6bj1F/avatar.jpg
```

**Cover Photo (estimated):**
```
https://i.ibb.co/bSZ6QMh/cover.jpg
```

Try these URLs in the Edit Profile page. If they don't work, follow Step 1 above to get the exact direct image URLs.

## Note:
The application now has fallback avatar handling, so even if the image URL is incorrect, you'll see a default generated avatar instead of a broken image.
